Workshop 1 provided an opportunity to dive into various aspects of C++
programming and reinforced fundamental concepts. It facilitated a deeper 
understanding of working with command-line arguments, header file 
organization, and dynamic memory allocation. By completing this workshop, 
I achieved several learning outcomes:

Primarily, the use command-line arguments using argc and argv parameters 
in the main function. This allowed me to accept and process input file 
names, showcasing my ability to receive program arguments from the 
command line effectively.

Also, the importance of header guards, ensuring that header files are 
included only once in a translation unit. This practice not only prevents 
errors but also promotes clean and organized code, aligning with good 
programming practices.

Next, understanding the distinction between internal and external linkage
was a pivotal point of learning. The global variables, g_taxrate and 
g_discount, served as practical examples of external linkage, highlighting 
how data can be shared across different translation units.

Later, the workshop's second part focused on dynamic memory allocation, 
which is essential skill for managing strings of varying lengths 
efficiently. Utilizing dynamic memory allocation with new and proper 
memory deallocation with delete were crucial in preventing memory leaks.

In conclusion, Workshop 1 significantly enriched my understanding of C++ 
programming concepts and techniques, aligning with the previosly stated 
learning outcomes. It equipped me with practical skills related to 
command-line processing, header file management, linkage, and dynamic 
memory allocation, which are fundamental for professional software 
development.
